stupid-news is a costumizable version of the [brutalist report](https://brutalist.report/about).
Its mostly intended as a learning project for me, but I also use it "productively" on [news.lorenzprattes.com](http://news.lorenzprattes.com).

# Configuring
Simply edit the FeedURLs in the config.yaml to change the default feed list

# Future Plans
I plan on establishing the use of a docker image, maybe a login system and mixed feeds for blogs that rarely post.
